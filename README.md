1. Project Title: Graphic Zeus ( Graphic Designing Service Website ) 

2. Project Description

This project, Graphic Zeus, is a multi-page web portfolio built to simulate a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience using only vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It showcases core front-end skills by delivering a fast, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing website for a fictional graphic design studio. It includes a Home page, Service listing, Portfolio section, and a Contact form, all navigated dynamically without page reloads.

3. Project Objectives

Responsive UI: Build a fully adaptive and professional-looking website using the Tailwind CSS utility framework.

SPA Emulation: Implement dynamic page routing using Vanilla JavaScript to provide a fluid user experience without full page refreshes.

Tool Proficiency: Demonstrate effective use of modern front-end tools, specifically integrating Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and custom configuration.

4. Tools Used and Their Usage in the Project

Tool/Technology

Usage in Project

HTML5

Core structure and semantic markup of the entire application.

Vanilla JavaScript

Implemented the main SPA logic to control page visibility and handle navigation state changes. Also managed mobile menu toggling.

Tailwind CSS

Used for all styling, including responsive layouts, custom color palette (brand colors), and consistent component styling (shadows, padding, etc.).

SVG Icons

Used scalable, vector icons for service cards and features for high-quality visuals.

5. Project Detail: Screenshots and Explanations

Here, you would include screenshots of your running application and explain the technical work involved in each section.

5.1. Navigation and Mobile Responsiveness

Explanation

Technical Detail: Mobile menu visibility is controlled by Vanilla JS, toggling the hidden class on click. All links pass a data-page attribute to the main JavaScript function to control content switching.

Technical Detail: The JavaScript function showPage(pageId) iterates over all page content sections (.page-content) and toggles their visibility. This is the core mechanism that mimics client-side routing.

5.2. Styling and Layout

Explanation

Technical Detail: Service cards are structured using a responsive grid (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3). Custom hover effects (translate and shadow) were added to showcase CSS transition skills via Tailwind utilities.

6. Project Conclusion and What I Have Learned

This project was a great opportunity to reinforce my front-end fundamentals and gain practical experience with a modern styling approach.

Key Learnings:

SPA Fundamentals: Successfully implementing routing logic without a framework demonstrated a solid understanding of manipulating the DOM and managing application state directly with JavaScript.

Tailwind Efficiency: I learned how significantly Tailwind CSS accelerates development and ensures design consistency. Configuring custom colors in tailwind.config was essential for branding.

Responsive Design: Gained experience managing complex layouts across multiple screen sizes using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:), ensuring a professional, mobile-first result.
